  You can capitalize or put symbols (like periods, hyphens, etc.) in your answer.
  When you're giving the place of a important location, put the country, not the city or state.
If your answer matches 80% or higher the actual answer, then it will be considered right.
You can have 1 redemption question at the end of the quiz if you get something wrong.
